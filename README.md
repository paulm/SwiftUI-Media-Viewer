# SwiftUI Media Viewer

A polished, SwiftUI-based media viewer for iOS that supports both images and videos with a native feel. This viewer provides a user experience similar to Apple's Photos app with smooth transitions, responsive gestures, and intuitive controls.

## Project Overview

This media viewer was designed with direct, responsive feedback as the top priority, where media follows the user's touch for a natural, intuitive experience.
