We've successfully fixed the MediaViewer implementation by ensuring all references to media items are consistent. The viewer now correctly uses loadedItems throughout, which allows it to work with both externally provided media items and ones loaded from the filesystem.

Key changes made:
1. Updated UI references to use loadedItems instead of mediaItems in the counter
2. Updated navigation buttons to check against loadedItems.count
3. Fixed the loadMediaItems function to update loadedItems
4. Ensured navigation functions check bounds against loadedItems

The app can now be built and tested in Xcode. It will display a grid of media thumbnails and allow you to:
- Tap on a thumbnail to open the full-screen viewer
- Swipe horizontally to navigate between media items
- Pinch to zoom on images
- Double-tap to zoom in/out
- Pull down to dismiss the viewer
- See proper navigation controls and counter
